<h1> Focus & Objective </h1>
The focus for the Houston team was Personal Identity and Governance. We developed the foundations of an application to assist refugees with professional backgrounds upload and store their documents, identification, and professional credentials for easy access when validating their information. The roadmap for the application includes peer-to-peer verification of credentials while also allowing different roles to be assigned to each user (i.e. admin, verification admin, user). Validata established security through JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) and the application can implement the use of biometrics as an added measure in the future. The app is desktop based now, but its goal is to ultimately become mobile. 

<h1> Technologies </h1>
The technology used for the hackathon were MongoDB, Javascript, JWT, Node.js, HTML, CSS.
